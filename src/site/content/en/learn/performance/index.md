## Welcome to Learn Performance!

Web performance is a crucial aspect of the user experience aspect that focuses on the speed at which pages load, as well as how responsive they are to user input. By ensuring that pages load fast and handle user input efficiently and quickly, you're giving people a much better experience, which can help you to better achieve the goals you have in mind for your website.

## Overview

Web performance may feel like a niche topic in web development—especially when you consider other aspects of the user experience such as [accessibility](/learn/a11y/) and [responsive design](/learn/design/)—but it is both a broad and incredible deep topic.

Given the depth of web performance, it's important that a course on the topic is both approachable, yet informative. The initial release of this course focuses on web performance fundamentals that beginners will find informative, but as time goes on, this course will gain more modules that focus on more advanced topics.

Each module in this series aims to have—whenever practically possible—a set of demos that supplement the content of a module and demonstrate key performance concepts, such as resource optimization, caching, and other aspects of web performance.

Here's what you'll learn:
